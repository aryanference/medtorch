# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit
helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

## Types of contributions

### Report bugs

Report bugs
[on GitHub](https://github.com/medtorch/medtorch/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=).

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

- Your MedTorch version.
- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help
wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Implement features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write documentation

MedTorch could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official MedTorch docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

### Submit feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at <https://github.com/medtorch/medtorch/issues>.

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)

## Get started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `medtorch` for local development.

### 1) Create an issue on the GitHub repository

It's good practice to first discuss the proposed changes as the feature might
already be implemented.

### 2) Fork the `medtorch` repository on GitHub

Click [here](https://github.com/medtorch/medtorch/fork) to create your fork.

### 3) Clone your fork locally

```bash
git clone git@github.com:your_github_username_here/medtorch.git
cd medtorch
```

### 4) Install your local copy into a virtual environment

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is recommended for development.
You can use [just](https://just.systems/) to set up the development environment.
This will 1) install `uv` if not found and 2) install `medtorch` and all its
dependencies:

```bash
just setup
```

### 5) Create a branch for local development using the issue number

For example, if the issue number is 55:

```bash
git checkout -b 55-name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

Now you can make your changes locally.

### 6) Run unit tests

When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the tests
using `pytest`:

```bash
uv run pytest -x
```

### 7) Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub

[Here's some great
advice to write good commit
messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit), and [here's some
more](https://medium.com/@joshuatauberer/write-joyous-git-commit-messages-2f98891114c4):

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix nasty bug"
git push origin 55-name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

### 8) Check documentation

If you have modified the documentation or some docstrings, build the docs and
verify that everything looks good:

```bash
just build-docs
```

You can also build, serve and automatically rebuild the docs every
time you modify them and reload them in the browser:

```bash
just serve-docs
```

### 9) Submit a pull request on GitHub

## Tips

To run a subset of tests:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/data/test_image.py
```
